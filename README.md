E-commerce Store: "The Breaw Master".

The program aims to create an online site for the sale of beer, displaying a showcase of various products.
Each product is accompanied by a short but effective description, with a price and an iconic image.

The main page has a navigation bar from which you can register or log in as a user.
Once logged in, you will be able to develop your own order, this through the support button located on each product, which allows you to add a personalized number of the same product to your cart.
With the help of the navigation bar we can move to the dedicated section of our cart. From here it is possible to modify your order with respect to the products that we had added to the cart.
After completing our cart using the "checkout" button located further down, we can move to the interface for reviewing the order, from which we can complete and confirm our order.
Once you have placed an order, you can view it under "My Orders" in the main navigation bar.
Finally, the navigation bar has a "Logout" option to disconnect your profile.

Further interface elements are purely decorative.
